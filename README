WIP ---------------------->

**Lighthouse Report:**

- Landing Page
  ![Landing Page Lighthouse](doc/01-light-index.jpg)


- Help Page
  The low accessibility score is attributed to the third-party iframe.
  While iframes can be useful for embedding third-party content, they can also introduce performance and accessibility challenges.
  The third-party iframe is heavy or not well-optimized. Iframes can disrupt the natural tabbing order, making it confusing for users relying on keyboards or screen readers to navigate.
  ![Thank you Lighthouse](doc/02-light-help.jpg)

- 404 Page
  The low accessibility score is attributed to the redirection. In order to ensure users are informed about the impending redirection, I have included a text warning stating that an automatic redirection will occur in 10 seconds unless they take action, in addition to the call to action that directs them back to the homepage.
